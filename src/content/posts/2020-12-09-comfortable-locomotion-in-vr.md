# Augmented Reality to assist Forklift Operators

In Warehouses with shelves more than 10 meters high, the visibility of the shelves and pallets is bare minimum. I worked with a Forklift manufacturing company to develop an Augmented Reality interface to assist forklift operators to do their tasks (pallet lifting, pallet racking etc).

Locomotion is still a problem in VR which has only half solution. My research aims to develop a comfortable and efficient comprehensive locomotion system that can be used for different distances. For small - medium distance navigation, I have developed a technique called "Trigger Walking" which mimics actual gait of humans.
